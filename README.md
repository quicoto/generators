# Reviews generator

Allows to quickly generate a markdown file for a new episode to be pasted into the [reviews repository](https://github.com/quicoto/reviews).

## To Do

```import * as SindresorhusSlugify from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@sindresorhus/slugify@2.1.0";```

- Create a Vanilla JS version
